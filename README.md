# Hollywood Actor Image Classification Model Data Analysis Project
Purpose: To create an image classification model with supervised machine learning models and investigate issues in the construction of similar models. 

In this project, a variety of machine learning models were experimented with such as Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Classification, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, SVM, and XG Boost. Ultimately, the SVM model resulted in the highest predictive probability of 63%.
